#	programming workshop with C and Python
-	written examples, like:
	-	(double) linked lists
	-	binary trees
	-	AVL trees
	-	backtracking
	-	...

-	allows you to take an overview how to write algorithms in C and / or Python
-	these code projects are well made for hobby projects, educational studying, ...

##	build and run
######	C programming
-	use the makefile to let build your application
	-	command: ```make```
-	the executable file ends with *.run
-	only tested for UNIX/Linux

######	Python programming
-	these codes are written with Python 3 (at least with version 3.10)
